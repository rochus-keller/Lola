This is the Lola-2 parser library used by LolaCreator. The library produces the AST used to crossref and navigate a Lola-2 project. For inforation about Lola-2 see https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/Lola/Lola2.pdf.

The library makes use of a parser generated by Coco/R based on input from EbnfStudio (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/EbnfStudio). There is no other dependency than the Qt Core library.

In order to regenerate CocoParser.cpp/h you have to use this version of Coco/R: https://github.com/rochus-keller/Coco
